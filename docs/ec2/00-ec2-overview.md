# What is EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 allows you to quickly scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in traffic. You can use EC2 to launch virtual servers, known as instances, on the AWS cloud.

## Key Features of EC2

One of the best things about EC2 is its flexibility and your ownership of the virtual server. You can choose the instance type, operating system, and software that best fits your needs.

As a sandbox environment, you can experiment with different configurations and settings without affecting your production environment. You can also create custom AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) to save time when launching new instances. Even if you don't have a lot of experience with cloud computing, EC2 is easy to use and offers a wide range of features to help you get started.

### Scalability

EC2 allows you to scale your compute capacity up or down based on your needs. You can launch instances in minutes and quickly scale your infrastructure to meet demand.

### Flexibility

EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized for different use cases. You can choose the instance type that best fits your workload, whether it's compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, or GPU-optimized.

### Security

EC2 instances are secure by default. You can use security groups and network access control lists to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances. You can also use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to your resources.

### Reliability

EC2 provides a highly reliable environment where instances are automatically distributed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure fault tolerance. You can also use Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

### Cost-Effective

EC2 offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where you only pay for the compute capacity you use. You can choose from On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances to optimize costs based on your workload.

## How we are going to use EC2

In this course, we will use EC2 to launch virtual servers on the AWS cloud. We will create and manage EC2 instances to host web applications, databases, and other services. We will also learn how to secure our instances, monitor their performance, and optimize costs. By the end of this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to use EC2 to build and deploy web applications on the AWS cloud.
