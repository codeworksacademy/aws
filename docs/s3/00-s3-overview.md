# Getting Started with S3 Buckets

Before you can start building and deploying web applications using AWS services, you need to create an S3 bucket. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an S3 bucket and setting up your development environment.

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

To create an S3 bucket, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. Click on the `Services` dropdown in the top navigation bar and select `S3` under `Storage`.

3. Click on the `Create bucket` button.

4. Enter a name for your bucket. Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts, so choose a name that is not already in use.

5. Choose a region for your bucket. Select a region that is geographically close to your users to reduce latency.

6. Configure the bucket settings. You can leave the default settings for now, but you can adjust them based on your requirements.

7. Review the settings and click the `Create bucket` button to create your S3 bucket.

8. Your S3 bucket is now created and ready to use. You can upload files to your bucket, configure permissions, and set up static website hosting as needed.
