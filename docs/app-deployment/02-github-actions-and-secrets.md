# Github Actions and Secrets

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository. You can use GitHub Actions to automate your workflows, create custom CI/CD pipelines, and integrate with other tools and services.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up GitHub Actions to deploy your web application to an EC2 instance. We will use GitHub Actions to build a Docker image, push it to DockerHub, and deploy it to an EC2 instance. We will also show you how to securely store your DockerHub credentials using GitHub Secrets.

## Assumptions

This guide assumes you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- A DockerHub account
- An EC2 instance running in your AWS account
