## Overview

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that allows you to host your website directly from a GitHub repository. It is a great way to showcase your projects, share documentation, or create a personal blog. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a GitHub Pages site and deploying your website.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need the following:

- A GitHub account
- A GitHub repository containing your website files
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

If you haven't already, create a new GitHub repository to host your website files. You can do this by clicking on the "New" button in your GitHub account and following the prompts to create a new repository.

### Step 2: Add Your Website Files

Add your website files to the repository. This can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and any other assets required for your site. Make sure to organize your files in a logical structure within the repository.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository, go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under the "Source" dropdown, select the branch that contains your website files (usually the main branch). Click "Save" to enable GitHub Pages for your repository.

### Step 4: Access Your Website

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, you will see a link to your hosted website in the "GitHub Pages" section of the repository settings. Click on the link to access your website. Your website will be hosted at a URL like `https://username.github.io/repository-name`.

### Step 5: Customize Your Website

You can customize your website by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your repository. You can also use themes and templates to quickly style your site. Make sure to commit your changes and push them to the repository to update your website.

### Step 6: Update Your Website

Whenever you make changes to your website files, commit the changes to your repository and push them to the branch that GitHub Pages is configured to use. Your website will automatically update with the latest changes.

## Conclusion

Hosting your website with GitHub Pages is a simple and effective way to share your projects with the world. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly set up a GitHub Pages site and deploy your website for others to see. Happy coding!
