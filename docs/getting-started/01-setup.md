# Welcome to CodeWorks

## Getting Started

To get started with CodeWorks, you will need to install the following software:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  + [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as dotnet and Unity).

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

### Git
