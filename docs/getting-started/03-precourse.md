The principles taught in this course are designed to assist students through the foundational elements of web development and prepare them for the CodeWorks Technical Challenge. After completing this course students should be ready to move beyond a web based coding environment and into a more professional environment standard if they so choose.

Throughout this course we will be using the Web Service repl.it which is a pre-set coding environment. These types of services are incredibly popular because they help to remove potential barriers that might get in the way of learning a new programing language due to a system misconfiguration.
