### VS Code extensions
vs code has a few extensions that makes developer's lives easier or more organized. Here is a list of extensions that will be required for the course. We will not use all of these right away.

**Required**
- **C#** from *Microsoft* (Base Language support)
- **ESLint** from *Microsoft*
- **MySQL** from *Weijan Chen*
- **Vue Language Feature (Volar)** from *Vue*

Below are extensions that are not required, but are highly recommended. Not all staff members use all of them, but we will use some of these during lectures from time to time.

**Recommended**
- **HTML CSS Support** from *ecmel* Gives completion suggestions for css styles that exists in your project.
- **Code Spell Checker** from *Street Side Software*. Checks the spelling in your code.
- **Comment Anchors** from *Starlane Studios*. Create special comments in your code you can easily find later
- **Peacock** from *John Papa*. Changes the color of the vscode window, helps makes projects unique.
- **Error Lens** from *Alexander*. Displays underlined errors or warnings on the same line in the editor.
- **Bootstrap 5 Quick Snippets** from *Anbuselvan Rocky*. Allows for easy inserts of Bootstrap 5 components.
- **Indent Rainbow** from *oderwat* and **Indent Rainbow Pallettes** from *evondev*. Colorizes your indents for more visibility.
- **Material Design Icons Intellisense** from *Lukas Troyer*. Shows icons used in your editor.
- **Inline HTML** from *colton*. Allows for easier writing of HTML templates in JS.
- **Format Selection As HTML** from *Adrian Wilczy≈Ñski*. Helps format our JS strings in HTML format.
- **vscode-pets** from *Anthony Shaw*. It's like having a little buddy with you while you code.

### VsCode Snippets
Snippets are like macros, it allows your to save chucks of code under a shorter command to access. CodeWorks has some that we use often throughout the course. 

 Head into vscode and open `file` then `preferences` from the toolbar. In `preferences` click `configure user snippets` then `new global snippets file`. You can name it what you want but `bcw snippets` is a good name too. You will be given a file with a lot of *commented* code (Green text) inside of two `{}`. Erase everything in this file, then copy the code below and paste it into it's place. Save and you are all set. We will go over using these snippets later.
