Do you remember the good ole days in school when copying someone elses work was frowned upon? Well today that is going to change. Without any repercussions. No detention, no staying after, and most importantly no phone call to the parents.

Believe it or not but copying another's work is a great way to get practice with a skill. Anyone who has learned to play an instrument is probably familiar with playing music they didn't write. It's important that we try to replicate their work without copying it exactly. In other words, just finding their code and copying it over.  There is still value in using their code when you write your own.

## Goals

In this challenge your goal is to replicate the design and layout of a given website.

This challenge will likely take some a chunk of time to complete fully, and it will test you so be sure to have some patience with yourself, <mark title="Setting a hard limit on the amount of time you 'struggle' when you run into an issue before getting help.">"timebox"</mark> your problems appropriately, and seek help when needed.

- Test your bootstrap skills by replicating its design.
- Understanding of page structure.
- Ability to adhere to design requirements.

## **Build Your Site**

### **Make a Game Plan**
Your first step should be building out the basic layout of the page. Sketching out the boxes for each section or piece of content can help when it comes to laying out the HTML.

### **Build it simple**
Keep it simple and complete each section of the project as you get to it, top to bottom. It's better to get build out rough approximations of each section now and clean them up later than to go for perfect replications right now.

Stick with the built in colors and styles from bootstrap. Use *lorem* generators and place holder images for your content.

### **Tune It In**

Now that we have our page done, we can go back with another pass from top to bottom perfecting it's look.
Create custom CSS classes and rules in conjunction with bootstraps styles to really tune in that look.

Fill out the text content with more appropriate verbiage and get find some really good images to drop in.

## **Wrapping Up**

Pat yourself on the back. Each of these sites are quite complex and would take a load of time to re-create.

If you're looking for a challenge we can do some things to make it functional.

* use `a` tags pointing to `id`s that allow users to navigate to certain sections of the page with just a click.

* add another section or replace a image on the site for a video. Look into `iframe`s and maybe find a content appropriate video on youtube.

* Build another site clone!

Sure, that last one sounds like loads of work but repetition is part of the learning process, you will get better and faster the more you do and getting better is what this course is all about. Find a site for a game or product you like and try to recreate that. Stay away from social sites like facebook or reddit as those are mostly repeating elements of content and don't offer much diversity in building.
