# Figma Design Lab

Welcome to the Figma Design Lab! In this lab, you'll embark on a creative journey to translate design concepts into functional web interfaces. The lab is divided into two key phases: Low Fidelity Mockup and High Fidelity Mockup, followed by the implementation of your design using `Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS` .

### Phase 1: Low Fidelity Mockup

Your journey begins with the Low Fidelity Mockup stage. Here, you'll conceptualize the basic structure and layout of your web page based on a provided image. Utilize basic shapes to focus on layout, content placement, and overall structure. This phase encourages ideation and a clear understanding of the design elements before diving into detailed implementation.

### Phase 2: High Fidelity Mockup

Building on your low fidelity mockup, it's time to add detail and precision in the High Fidelity Mockup phase. Become familiar with Figma as you begin to create a pixel-perfect representation of your web page. Pay attention to colors, typography, images, and any interactive elements. This stage serves as a blueprint for your final implementation.

### Phase 3: Implementation with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS

Now comes the exciting partâ€”bringing your mockup to life! Using Bootstrap for responsive design, HTML for structuring your content, and CSS for styling, you'll replicate your high fidelity mockup as a fully functional website. Consider the responsiveness of your design, ensuring it looks and behaves well on various devices.

**Lab Objectives:**
1. Develop a low fidelity sketch and high fidelity mockup based on the provided image.
2. Implement the high fidelity mockup using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
3. Ensure responsiveness for a seamless user experience across devices.
4. Pay attention to details such as typography, colors, and spacing for a polished design.
