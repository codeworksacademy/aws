# Interacting with the DOM and Events

Today we will be learning how to interact with the DOM and how to handle events in JavaScript. [The Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. We can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to change the content, structure, and style of a web page.
