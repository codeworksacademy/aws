# JavaScript Functions, Objects, and Loops

In this lesson we will cover the basics of JavaScript functions, objects, and loops. We will learn how to create functions, pass parameters, and return values. We will also learn how to create objects and arrays, and how to use loops to iterate over them. This lesson will help provide the foundations needed to build more complex applications.
