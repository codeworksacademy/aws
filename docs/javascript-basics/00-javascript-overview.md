# Introduction to JavaScript

The JavaScript chapter is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. Students will learn how to write JavaScript code, manipulate the DOM, and create interactive web pages. The chapter will cover topics such as data types, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming. By the end of this chapter, students will have a basic understanding of JavaScript and be able to create dynamic web pages.

### Goals

* [ ] Fundamentals of Javascript, Code Execution Order
* [ ] Data types (Reference vs Value)
* [ ] Managing control flow with Loops and Conditionals
* [ ] Dom manipulation with native JavaScript
* [ ] Writing Reusable Functions abstraction
* [ ] SOLID & Pillars of OOP

  + [Variables using `var` `let` or `const` (*Hoisting*)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp)
  + [Primitives/Value Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
  + [Assignment vs Declaration](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp)
  + [PEMDAS - Order of Operations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html)
  + Conditional Statements [Truthy](https://developer.) & Falsy
  + [Switches](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp)
  + [Reference Types Objects & Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)
  + [Using `debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger)
  + [What is an event (`onclick`)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp)
  + Functions and Parameters reference vs value and returns
  + [Passing arguments from the DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp)
* **Lesson 2**
  + Object Comparison and equality
  + Complex Objects
  + Bracket Notation
  + Loops (*identify the benefit and value of an alias*)
  + [Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) (find, filter, destructive methods)
  + Lambda or query syntax (use the word *where* for `=>`)
  + Invoking functions from the console
* **Lesson 3**
  + `.getElementById` or `.querySelector`
  + Element Manipulation `classList`
  + understanding `on`
  + Emphasize single responsibility principle
* **Lesson 4**
  + preventContext `event.preventDefault()`
  + `oncontextmenu` attributes
  + Working with Dictionaries
  + Object Iteration (*for in*)
  + Timeouts and Intervals
  + Using Audio elements

**Destructive Methods**

The following methods are destructive, meaning they will change the original array.

```js
// destructive methods
arr.splice
arr.pop
arr.shift
arr.unshift
arr.push
arr.sort
```
